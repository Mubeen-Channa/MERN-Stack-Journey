    Psedu Class: Specify Special State of Selected element.

                A pseudo-class in CSS is used to define a special state of an element.
                It is used to style an element when it is in a certain state or condition, 
                such as when a user hovers over an element or when an element is the target of a link. 
                Pseudo-classes are preceded by a colon : in CSS.

    3. :checked     : Used for Radio and Checked Elements
    4. :nth-of-type : Used to select indivisual or even or odd element
